Ladies and gentlemen, good day and welcome to the SJS Enterprises 1Q FY24 Earnings
Conference Call hosted by JM Financial. From JM Financial Institutional Securities, I welcome you all to 1Q FY24 Earnings Call of SJS
Enterprises. 7%
YoY. 
We added two marquee customers to our already large portfolio, Toyota Tsusho and Autoliv. 6% on YoY
basis while the industry production volume grew by 7%. 3% YoY, while SJS witnessed a robust growth
of 18. I would now like to hand over the call to Mahendra  our CFO to update you on the SJS financial
performance before I talk to you about the future growth. 8% on YoY basis on account of new business wins and
gradual export market recovery. Thapar to talk about our future plans and
growth outlook. This rework aims to create a more conducive strategy that can accommodate the changing needs
and demands of both companies. In the interim, we have chartered out an alternate plan so that
Exotech growth does not get hampered in the short run. No, it's not delayed, it's a conscious decision on our part, because when we guided you on
expansion, we see a very robust demand coming in by cross selling Exotech products to existing
SJS customers. We are always referring that we will maintain our growth rate of 20% to 25% and Walter Pack
will be part of that. So let me supplement that by giving you an outlook on Walter Pack. And overall, I would like you to think of us as an entity that has an end-to-end
solution for all aesthetic parts and Walter Pack is going to actually help us introduce a lot of new
technologies to the customers in India and overseas. Our strategy always has been that we take customers and we grow them into mega counts. So that has been the theme and that will be the theme for both these customers
as well. So we have some prototype build requirements or projects going on with a few
customers. And overall for the year
in fact exports took a dip of almost 32% degrowth, but this year we are seeing the demand
coming back in Europe as well as we are winning new businesses on our export front. In our last earnings call, I mentioned that we will be accelerating
our growth footprint. So those are the growth vectors for Walter
Pack.
